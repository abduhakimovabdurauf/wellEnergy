                description: "Carbamide contains nitrogen, which is one of the main elements necessary for photosynthesis and plant growth. In addition, carbamide-based fertilizer has antimicrobial and anti-pest properties. This helps protect plants from diseases and pests, which in turn promotes growth and yield.\n The use of carbamide-based mineral fertilizers is very simple. It is enough to dilute the fertilizer in water and water the plants. It can also be used as a top dressing or foliar top dressing. This makes it convenient to use for gardeners and gardeners. Carbamide is an excellent choice for those who want to provide their plants with optimal conditions for growth and development. Its unique properties allow not only to improve yields, but also to make plants more resistant to stressful conditions.",
